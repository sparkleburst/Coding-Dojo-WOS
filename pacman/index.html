    <!-- Interesting note. If you have <div class="whatever"></div> <div class="whatever"></div> 
    written in or fed to html via javascript with a space between the closing div and the next openeing div then html will put a space between whatever the things are that is supposed to be in the <div> output. So don't have a space unless you intend for one to be there. Make sure it's written as or fed as <div class="whatever"></div><div class="whatever"></div> without any space between. -->

    <!-- To take care of the vertical spaces I had to include vertiacl vertical-align: top; -->
